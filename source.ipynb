    "Many companies, esspecially in the IT sector, allowed employees to work from home during covid and some have continued the trend. It is still unclear if employers should allow their employees to work from home. I find this esspecially interesting since I find that my productivity drops drastically when I am in office but as I understand it most people are far more productive in the office than at home. "

    "Some visualizations like bar charts to show productivity changes over time, heatmaps to explore factors influencing productivity, and pie charts for comparing remote vs. in-office work outcomes could be a part of the answer. Ultimately I think the answer to this question will be data comparing factors like mental health, stress, productivity, engagement, coworker relations, and company profit (specifically looking at costs of outfitting employees to work from home vs housing them in an office and potentially having to do both) before and after remote work to see how the numbers stack up for both sides."
