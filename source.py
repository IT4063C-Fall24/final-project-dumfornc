# # Effectiveness of Remote Employeesüìù
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# Many companies, esspecially in the IT sector, allowed employees to work from home during covid and some have continued the trend. It is still unclear if employers should allow their employees to work from home. I find this esspecially interesting since I find that my productivity drops drastically when I am in office but as I understand it most people are far more productive in the office than at home. 

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# Does working from home ultimately benifit employees and employeers?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# Some visualizations like bar charts to show productivity changes over time, heatmaps to explore factors influencing productivity, and pie charts for comparing remote vs. in-office work outcomes could be a part of the answer. Ultimately I think the answer to this question will be data comparing factors like mental health, stress, productivity, engagement, coworker relations, and company profit (specifically looking at costs of outfitting employees to work from home vs housing them in an office and potentially having to do both) before and after remote work to see how the numbers stack up for both sides.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 3 Data Sources:
# - Teleworking during the pandemic (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mpwolke/cusersmarildownloadsremotexlsx?resource=download)
# - Remote Work Productivity (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/remote-work-productivity)
# - Top challenges and advantages of remote work (https://www.gallup.com/401384/indicator-hybrid-work.aspx)
# - Remote Work & Mental Health (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)
# - Relationship Between Remote Work and Productivity (https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-13/remote-work-productivity.htm)
# 
# I don't see ways to merge these specific datasets (though I may discover and merge others later) but mostly I plan to syntesize the data from multiple of these sources to create graphics by putting data on differnet topics side by side to show pros and cons of remote work.

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*

# higher levels of wellness than in-office employees.

# This visualization shows the the breakdown of amount of stress among the differnt work types.

remoteProductivityRelationDf.plot.scatter('Percentage point increase in remote workers', 'Excess TFP Growth')


# This chart shows industries that had increased in remote workers durring 2020 and how their excess TFP growth changed. Higher TFP is better for the economy so a corratation between increases in remote workers and TFP could show if remote work tends to be helpful or not. Unfortunatly there does not appear to be a strong corralation either way. Perhapse slightly possitive but not conclusive.

# This chart goes with the one above it showing the top things remote employees considered challenges. There was much more agreement that there were serious benifits than there was agreement that there were serious drawbacks. This would seem to suggest that remote employees liked working remote.

# ## Machine Learning Plan
# - I will try a polynomial regression with remote_work_productivity.csv to predict the productivity of employees
# - I am worried that there will not be enough data to train the model well as not all of the data seems to be particularly interlinked
# - I will experiment with several different degrees to see if any of them can get a good fit

# ## Machine Learning Implementation Process
# 

# #### Ask

# In[19]:


# I will be working with productivity_df

# The employee ID column is not going to be of use to us so lets remove it before we start doing any work with the data
productiviy_df_noID = productiviy_df.drop('Employee_ID', axis=1)

# In this info display we can see that there are no null values
print(productiviy_df_noID.info())

# This describe gives us an idea of the scale of the numerical columns, their ranges are similar and should not need much, if any, adjustment
print(productiviy_df_noID.describe())


# #### Prepare

# In[20]:


# I am not a SME but I don't see any variables that we need to split the data by so I am going to use a standard test_train_split
train_set, test_set = model_selection.train_test_split(productiviy_df_noID, test_size=.2, random_state=7)

productivity_X = train_set.drop('Productivity_Score', axis=1)
productivity_Y = train_set['Productivity_Score'].copy()

print(productivity_X.head())
print('-------------')
print(productivity_Y.head())


# #### Process

# In[21]:


# Start by splitting X into numerical and catagorical
productivity_train_cat = productivity_X[['Employment_Type']]
productivity_train_num = productivity_X.drop('Employment_Type', axis=1)

# As I mentioned above there are no missing values to impute so we are skipping that step

# I don't think this data should need a large amount of scalling but lets do it just in case (and to demonstrate I can)
