# Effectiveness of Remote Employees

## Project Overview
I wanted to look at performance indicators for remote and in person employees to see which modality was better both for the company and for the employee.

## Self Assessment and Reflection

### Self Assessment
<!-- Replace the (...) with your score -->

| Category          | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **Setup**         | 5 / 10 |
| **Execution**     | 15 / 20 |
| **Documentation** | 5 / 10 |
| **Presentation**  | 25 / 30 |
| **Total**         | 40 / 70 |

### Reflection
I don't think I did very well on this project, I was very busy this semster and unmodivated to work on this project because class is just not an area that I am interested in. I basically did nothing with it until a checkpoint was right around the corner and then i crammed on it and I think it shows. I was constantly a little late on delivering checkpoints and even the final presentation. I met the bare minimum requirements most of the time but it was hard to do and I am not very proud of what I did overall. I have a couple things I think I did well like the functions to test several different machine learing degrees and to test the model on remote vs in-person versions of the same employee for several employees but overall this was not my best work.

#### What went well?
When I was actually able to just write code, which is something I enjoy doing, I feel like i came up with clever solutions and did good work.
#### What did not go well?
Most of the actual data anaylsis, getting good data, correlating the data, being on time with my work.
#### What did you learn?
I learned a lot about machine learning exxpecially how to make the pipelines and apply those.
#### What would you do differently next time?
I would start sooner and I would reorient my schedual so that I was starting this work earlier so that it would be done better and on time.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
